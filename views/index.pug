          p.about__text Cayla is a young baker with a passion for healthy living. She studied at Texas A&M before transferring to San Diego State University. Cayla lives on a strict diet, and finding "off the shelf" bakery snakes that taste great has proven difficult. So, taking matters into her own hands, she started baking healthy gluten free cookies. After some trial and error she has dialed in her recipe and is ready share delicious cookies with you.
          p.about__text When Cayla isn't baking, you can find her out enjoying the outdoors. She is an avid golfer, hiker, skier, swimmer, guitarist, and off road enthusiast. Cayla enjoys all aspects of life, making the most of every day. Her experiences make her a powerful person and excellent role model/leader.
          p.about__text If you are looking for delicious, healthy, homemade cookies crafted by someone who lives life to the fullest <br><br> Then contact Cayla, and she will take care of you.
